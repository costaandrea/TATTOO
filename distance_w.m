function [D,B]=distance_w(conn)
%DISTANCE_WEI       Distance matrix
%
%   D = distance_w(L);
%   [D,B] = distance_w(L);
%
%   The distance matrix contains lengths of shortest paths between all
%   pairs of nodes. An entry (u,v) represents the length of shortest path 
%   from node u to node v. The average shortest path length is the 
%   characteristic path length of the network.
%
%   Input:      L,      Directed/undirected connection-length matrix.
%   *** NB: The length matrix L isn't the weights matrix W (see below) ***
%
%   Output:     D,      distance (shortest weighted path) matrix
%               B,      number of edges in shortest weighted path matrix
%
%   Notes:
%       The input matrix must be a connection-length matrix, typically
%   obtained via a mapping from weight to length. For instance, in a
%   weighted correlation network higher correlations are more naturally
%   interpreted as shorter distances and the input matrix should
%   consequently be some inverse of the connectivity matrix. 
%       The number of edges in shortest weighted paths may in general 
%   exceed the number of edges in shortest binary paths (i.e. shortest
%   paths computed on the binarized connectivity matrix), because shortest 
%   weighted paths have the minimal weighted distance, but not necessarily 
%   the minimal number of edges.
%       Lengths between disconnected nodes are set to Inf.
%       Lengths on the main diagonal are set to 0.
%
%   Algorithm: Dijkstra's algorithm.
