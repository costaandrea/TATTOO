function Z=module_degree_zscore(W,Ci,flag)
%module_degree_zscore calculates the within-module degree z-score
%
%   Z=module_degree_zscore(W,Ci,flag);
%
%   The within-module degree z-score is a within-module version of degree
%   centrality.
%
%   Inputs:     W,      binary/weighted, directed/undirected connection matrix
%               Ci,     community affiliation vector
%               flag,   0, undirected graph (default)
%                       1, directed graph: out-degree
%                       2, directed graph: in-degree
%                       3, directed graph: out-degree and in-degree
%
%   Output:     Z,      within-module degree z-score.
