function newconn = newproba(conn)
%newproba Reverses the probability of the edges in the
% connectivity matrix CONN
% See Costa et al. (2017???), PlosOne, for details.
%
% Inputs: CONN is a connectivity matrix
% Output: NEWCONN is the connectivity matrix with reversed probabilities
%
% As default the zero values are not touched. The aternative would be to 
% transform them into infinity values. This choice is uninfluential on the
% output of the Dijkstra algorithm in its original form (Dijkstra, 19??) or
% in the form proposed by Brandon (Brandon 1980?). MAKE SURE that this is
% also your case.
% Note that infinity vlaues may screw up graph plotting scripts.
