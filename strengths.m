%of the nodes in a graph

%   [ins,outs,tots] = strengths(CONN,FAC);
%   Inputs: CONN is a connectivity matrix
%           FAC is the factor multiplying the diagonal of conn (set =0 to
%               erase the self-loops)
%   Output:     ins is the  node instrength
%               outs  is the node outstrength
%               tots is the totale node strength (instrength + outstrength)
