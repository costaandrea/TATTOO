function mp = meanpath(conn)
%meanpath calculates the average shortest path of a graph
%   mp =  meanpath(CONN);
%
%   Inputs: CONN is a connectivity matrix
%           
%   Output: mp is the verage shortest path
%
% Note that you must ensure whether CONN must store revered edge values or
%not.
%
% Infinite paths are set to NaN and not considered.
%
% This function requires distance_w.m
