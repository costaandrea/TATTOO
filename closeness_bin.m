function closen = closeness_bin(conn)
%closeness calculats the closeness cetrality
%
%   Input: CONN is a (binary or weighted) connectivity matrix
%
%   Output: CLOSEN is the array with the closeness centrality values
%
% The distance is calculated on the binary matrix and the terms
% on the diagonal are ignored.
