function [id,od,deg] = degrees_dir(CIJ)
%DEGREES_DIR  Calculates In-degree and Out-degree
%
%   [id,od,deg] = degrees_dir(CIJ);
%
%   Node degree is the number of links connected to the node. The indegree 
%   is the number of inward links and the outdegree is the number of 
%   outward links.
%
%   Input:      CIJ,    directed (binary/weighted) connection matrix
%
%   Output:     id,     node indegree
%               od,     node outdegree
%               deg,    node degree (indegree + outdegree)
%
%   Notes:  Inputs are assumed to be on the columns of the CIJ matrix.
%           Weight information is discarded.
