function D=distance_bin(A)
%DISTANCE_BIN       Distance matrix
%
%   D = distance_bin(A);
%
%   The distance matrix contains lengths of shortest paths between all
%   pairs of nodes. An entry (u,v) represents the length of shortest path 
%   from node u to node v. The average shortest path length is the 
%   characteristic path length of the network.
%
%   Input:      A,      binary directed/undirected connection matrix
%
%   Output:     D,      distance matrix
%
%   Notes: 
%       Lengths between disconnected nodes are set to Inf.
%       Lengths on the main diagonal are set to 0.
%
%   Algorithm: Algebraic shortest paths.
