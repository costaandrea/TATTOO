function [true_clusters, frequest, m]= trueclusters(clusters)
%trueclusters finds the most frequent cluster from the list of clusters
% issued from the mdularity algorithm
%
%   Inputs: CLUSTERS is the list of indexes indicatng the cluster of the
%            nodes
%           
%   Output: TRUE_CLUSTERS  is the list of equivalent clusters
%           FREUEST        is the most commonly found cluster
%           M              is the number of times that FREQUEST was found
