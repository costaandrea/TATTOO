function C=clustering_coef_wd(conn)
%clustering_coef_wd Calculates the clustering coefficient of the nodes in
% a graph.
%
%   C = clustering_coef_wd(CONN);
%
%   The weighted clustering coefficient is the average "intensity"
%   (geometric mean) of all triangles associated with each node.
%
%   Input:      CONN,      weighted directed connection matrix
%                       (all weights must be between 0 and 1)
%
%   Output:     C,      clustering coefficient vector
%
%   Reference: Fagiolo (2007) Phys Rev E 76:026107.
%
%   Note:   All weights must be between 0 and 1.
%           This may be achieved using the weight_conversion.m function,
%           W_nrm = weight_conversion(W, 'normalize');

%   Modification history:
%   2007: original
%   2015: expanded documentation


%   Methodological note (also see clustering_coef_bd)
%   The weighted modification is as follows:
%   - The numerator: adjacency matrix is replaced with weights matrix ^ 1/3
%   - The denominator: no changes from the binary version
%
%   The above reduces to symmetric and/or binary versions of the clustering 
%   coefficient for respective graphs.


A=conn~=0;                     %adjacency matrix
S=conn.^(1/3)+(conn.').^(1/3);	%symmetrized weights matrix ^1/3
K=sum(A+A.',2);            	%total degree (in + out)
cyc3=diag(S^3)/2;           %number of 3-cycles (ie. directed triangles)
K(cyc3==0)=Inf;             %if no 3-cycles exist, make C=0 (via K=inf)
CYC3=K.*(K-1)-2*diag(A^2);	%number of all possible 3-cycles
C=cyc3./CYC3;               %clustering coefficient
