function [BC,P]=betweenness_w(conn)
%BETWEENNESS_WEI    Node betweenness centrality
%
%   BC = betweenness_wei(L);
%
%   Node betweenness centrality is the fraction of all shortest paths in 
%   the network that contain a given node. Nodes with high values of 
%   betweenness centrality participate in a large number of shortest paths.
%
%   Input:      L,      Directed/undirected connection-length matrix.
%
%   Output:     BC,     node betweenness centrality vector.
%
%   Notes:
%       The input matrix must be a connection-length matrix, typically
%   obtained via a mapping from weight to length. For instance, in a
%   weighted correlation network higher correlations are more naturally
%   interpreted as shorter distances and the input matrix should
%   consequently be some inverse of the connectivity matrix. 
%       Betweenness centrality may be normalised to the range [0,1] as
%   BC/[(N-1)(N-2)], where N is the number of nodes in the network.
